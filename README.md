# PyconKE2022

This repo contains the presentation materials for *Detecting Systematic Deviations in Data and Models*. 
This is a workshop session for Python Kenya 2022, cohosted by Adebayo Oshingbesan and Tanya Akumu.

## Synopsis
Systematic deviations in data and models are common phenomena in machine learning. Detecting these subsets of data that deviate from expectations can be used during exploratory data analysis to understand patterns that exists in data. This could be useful in other data modelling/ analytics tasks and could also be used to discover anomalies which may highlight issues around data collection/ labelling that may be present in the data. Furthermore, detecting systematic deviations in a modelâ€™s predictions could be used to infer new classification rules, update an underfitted model, detect bias in models, detect concept drift in a deployed system or discover novel treatment effects from an intervention.  This workshop will provide data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers with motivation, theory, code, and examples of how to perform disciplined discovery of systematic deviations in data and models at the subset level.  For maximal benefits, participants are expected to have basic knowledge of NumPy and Pandas.
